# Bacteria Cultivation
# Overview

For this project, an interactive web page was built using JavaScript. D3.JSON, and HTML was also used so that a completed panel demographic is visualized for each volunteer via a bubble, bar, and guage graph using PLOTLY. All bacterial data for each volunteer can be selected by a drop down menu by their ID number. All personal information is anonymous for volunteer personal safety.
